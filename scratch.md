# What I want

A nested directory structure with each usr txt as its own pdf.... ie.
`user_manual/getting_started/usr_01_about_the_manuals.pdf`

# What I fear

That doing this in a piece-meal way will result in broken links... I'm as of yet
unsure if this matters as my primary goal is to have a bunch of small pieces
that I can work through reading on the remarkable.
